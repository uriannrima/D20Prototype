1) Create an plane over the terrain + buildings
	2 possible ways:
		1) Cache height and small plane
			1) Copy height data from the terrain and from buildings
			2) Position an plane in the camera, that will emulate the fog above the things
			3) Get height data from the cache, put on the plane
		2) Create plane with height already
			1) Create plane
			2) On creation set height of each vertice with the height from terrain or building
			3) Create multiple planes to bigger terrains (since there is a limit of vertices per mesh)
	1) Terrain To Plane creates an Plane over the Terrain and Buildings
	2) Sometimes, gets a litle bit clumsy, out of position
2) Create an texture with the plane size
3) Manipulate texture to open holes on visible points
	Using a bit mask:
		0 - Non Visible
		1 - Visible
	Later, look about alpha, but let start it easy
4) Line of Sight on visible points, for the time, lets just make a circle, then we see about LOS
